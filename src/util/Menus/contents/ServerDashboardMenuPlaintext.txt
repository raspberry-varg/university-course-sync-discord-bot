:twisted_rightwards_arrows: __**Deleted a channel or role on accident?**__\n
> `/refresh all` should do the trick!\n
> It will refresh and validate all the channels and roles in the server, along with comb through every member that is a part of Course Sync, and prompt an update to their own roles as well. Hopefully this will be a rare occurrence, but it is a lovely safeguard to have just in case something goes awry!\n
\n
:arrows_counterclockwise: __**Didn't hit refresh in time?**__\n
> `/refresh channels` is the way to go!\n
> It will append new roles to channels, create new channels if needed, delete roles and channels that are no longer supported by you, or all three!\n
> However, `/refresh all` will be a better choice if you now support more courses, as user roles will be updated too!\n
\n
:tea: __**Thank you for using Course Sync**__\n
> Course Sync's mission is to provide a safe, fun, and easy way for students to sync their courses along school servers that offer channels for students to collaborate and share ideas within.\n
> It is beyond humbling to have incredible users like yourself implement Course Sync within yet another community.\n
> Thank you once again, and wishing you a wonderful rest of your winter holiday break. See you all Wednesday! :snowflake:\n
